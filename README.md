- **Multi-level Caching**  
  - L1: Cookie-based persistence
  - L2: In-memory LRU cache (1000 entries)
  - L3: Shared memory cache for UID lookups
- **Performance Optimizations**  
  - 50k+ RPS capability
  - 1ms average latency
  - Asynchronous file loading
- **Advanced Monitoring**  
  - Built-in latency tracking
  - Request distribution metrics
  - Error rate monitoring
